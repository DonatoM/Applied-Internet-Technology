[Homework #1 - Blackjack](http://foureyes.github.io/csci-ua.0480-fall2014-002/assignments.html#hw01)

Create a commandline player Blackjack game with 2 players - the user and the computer.

    (1) Each player is dealt 2 cards from a 52 card deck, with each card representing some numeric value
    (2) Each player can choose to be dealt more cards ("hit") or stop being dealt cards ("stand")
    (3) The sum of the numeric values of the cards in a player's hand determines if they've one
    (4) Once both players have either chosen to stand or have a hand with a total that's more than 21 ("bust"), the hands are compared
    (5) The player with the hand that's closest to 21 without going over wins
    ties are possible (either same total, or both player "bust")
